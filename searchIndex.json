This meticulously researched book reveals a more complete picture of the social conditions that led to the Holocaust. The creation of stateless zones, the hollowing or destruction of institutions, &amp; the zero-sum worldview that incentivized ordinary people to reach for the state's levers of murder. All part of an extra-legal machine meant to encourage violent experimentation that could be reified back into the state.\nMany of the stories are very difficult to read: the murder of children, the improvisation of cars as mobile gas chambers, the woman who was buried alive &amp; naked in a pit of corpses. Other details are horrifying in their mundanity: the Nazis originally provided extra rations of alcohol to soldiers who participated in mass murder, but ultimately found it unnecessary.\nThere are also many tales of those who resisted or rescued Jews, often not out of ideology or bravery, but out of the simple humanity the state could not stamp out (&quot;No one ever left my house naked or hungry&quot; one woman explains).\nIt is of course terrifying to recognize that many of these conditions exist today. The extraordinary renditions and the state machinery that enables it, the tech capitalists who wish to be freed from the &quot;inefficiencies&quot; of democracy to innovate in stateless zones, the paranoid, zero-sum worldview of MAGA.... &quot;a warning&quot;\nHighlighted\nMostly listened on audiobooks so only a couple of highlights.\n\nThroughout Europe, this is what rescuers said again and again: that they were behaving normally. “We regarded it as the most normal thing to help those who needed help”—thus the verdict of a Polish family who sheltered two Jews for much of the war. They were not describing the normality that they saw around them, of course. They were not acting as others acted, or following the explicit or implicit prescriptions of those in power. Their sense of normality must have come from within, or from something learned and internalized before the war, since there were few or no external sources of the norms they exemplified\n\nWanda J.’s judgment about the decisive importance of a sense of humanity seems like a hopeful conclusion, but it is not. Good and evil can be rendered visible, as in memoirs such as hers, but they are not easy to summon or dismiss. Most of us would like to think that we possess the qualities she named: “moral instinct” and “human goodness.” Perhaps we imagine that we would be rescuers in some future catastrophe. Yet if states were destroyed, local institutions corrupted, and economic incentives directed towards murder, few of us would behave well.",

He aims for 10% reduction\n\nHighlighted\n\nI believe large numbers of people have at least some talent as writers and storytellers, and that those talents can be strengthened and sharpened.\n\n&quot;When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.&quot;\n\nWhat you need to remember is that there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not.\n\nThe situation comes first. The characters—always flat and unfeatured, to begin with—come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate.\n\nA strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me.\n\nDescription begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.\n\nWhen it comes to scene-setting and all sorts of description, a meal is as good as a feast\n\nIn a very real sense, every life is in medias res.\n\nThe most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest.",

Butler\nFinished: <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-08-03</a>\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐\nThoughts: I enjoyed this, but not as much as I was hoping. This novel suffers from a common sci-fi problem, which is that most of the book is a setup for future sequels (that Butler never got around to finishing). The dystopian world of a collapsing America certainly has a prophetic quality, but I guess frustrating for me is Butler's refusal to engage in any kind of worldbuilding. She's no Ursula Le Guin, unfortunately. The politicians &amp; movements that led to this capitalist dystopia are named only at the very beginning and the very end with no real insight or explanation into the broader context of the protagonist's journey. Instead, we get fortune-cookie level philosophy about the Earthseed movement and a lot of talk about the protagonist's hyper-empathy syndrome, neither of which I found particularly interesting to the events of this book as a singular dystopian work.\nHighlighted\n\n“The changes.” I thought for a moment. They were slow changes compared to anything that might happen here, but it took a plague to make some of the people realize that things could change.”\n“So?”\n“Things are changing now, too. Our adults haven’t been wiped out by a plague so they’re still anchored in the past, waiting for the good old days to come back. But things have changed a lot, and they’ll change more. Things are always changing. This is just one of the big jumps instead of the little step-by-step changes that are easier to take. People have changed the climate of the world. Now they’re waiting for the old days to come back.”\n\nIt would be more honest to say that the Pox was caused by our own refusal to deal with obvious problems in those areas. We caused the problems: then we sat and watched as they grew into crises.",

The first story, &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot;, was the strongest and most memorable - a cosmic horror take on the unreliable narrator. After that they get less interesting as the book progresses, replacing the &quot;weird&quot; supernatural aspects with more typical themes.\nObviously, the reason to read this is the primordial connection to Lovecraft's later works and for that purpose I did enjoy it. I can't help but agree with this contemporary critic's quote from Wikipedia:\n\n&quot;So much of Mr Chambers's work exasperates, because we feel that he might so easily have made it better.&quot;\n-- Frederic Taber Cooper\n\nOnly the first four stories are worth reading and the rest can be skipped.\nHighlights\n\nCamilla: You, sir, should unmask.\nStranger: Indeed?\nCassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.\nStranger: I wear no mask.\nCamilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda) No mask? No mask!",

The Personal Data Server is the network unit that serves as a repository for user data, identity, and media on the network.\nI would just like to inject in everyone&#x27;s imaginations that at least one (1) path to a network of many networks, a fediverse of many fediverses, is a community of many communities. And that might mean more people should found new communities. And tools should be developed to make that easier.&mdash; Rudy wants revolution. (@rudyfraser.com) Jul 19, 2025 at 8:39 AM\nWhy self host?\n\nProtocols, Not Platforms by Mike Masnick\nInformation Civics by Paul Frazee\nSocial media’s next evolution a conversation about Blacksky with Rudy Fraser\n\nResources\n\nPDS on Github - the software to run your own PDS\npdsls.dev - handy tool for browsing your PDS\npdsadmin-web - a web based tool for performing some basic admin functions\nPDS Moover - migrate accounts between PDS\nIndependent PDS Directory\n\nSetting up the PDS\nRunning the official PDS Docker container is pretty simple. It's pretty lightweight, so you don't need a fancy server to run it. I use the OCI Free Tier for both my server and their object storage (S3). You could definitely do this on something like a Raspberry Pi.\nBefore starting this process, you'll want to set up DNS records with your domain provider and give them some time to propagate.\nThe Github repo has a script you can use to set all this up automatically. You probably just want to do that!\nI already have a server and proxy running with some other software, so I just need to add the PDS to my existing Docker Compose stack.\nThe relevant portion of my Compose file:\npds:\ncontainer_name: pds\nimage: ghcr.io/bluesky-social/pds:latest\nnetworks:\n- public-proxy\nrestart: unless-stopped\nvolumes:\n- /home/ubuntu/pds/data:/pds\nenv_file:\n- /home/ubuntu/pds/pds.env\n\nRunning the container will create a template pds.env file at that location specified, which you can then fill out with your secrets and SMTP credentials.\nOCI S3\nI also set up S3 storage, which Bayley Townsend's howto was helpful for figuring out (also the OCI S3 compatibility doc). Doing so stores the media in the cloud, so our server's disk space doesn't get eaten up with user content like photos or videos.\nGetting set up with OCI S3 was, of course, not that straightforward:\n\nMake note of your Region Identifier ex: us-sanjose-1\nMake a new Object Storage bucket on your account.\nOn Bucket Details page, change visibility to Public\nMake note of the Namespace on the Bucket Details page\nGo to your User Profile -&gt; User Settings. Select Tokens and Keys\nScroll down to Customer secret keys\nGenerate a Secret key it will only be shown once\nBack on the previous page, you now need to copy the Access key from ...\n\nNow we have everything we need to add our secrets to our pds.env file:\nPDS_BLOBSTORE_S3_BUCKET=&lt;bucket name&gt;\nPDS_BLOBSTORE_S3_REGION=&lt;region&gt;\nPDS_BLOBSTORE_S3_ENDPOINT=https://&lt;namespace&gt;.objectstorage.&lt;region&gt;.oraclecloud.com\nPDS_BLOBSTORE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&lt;accesskey&gt;\nPDS_BLOBSTORE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;secretkey&gt;\nPDS_BLOBSTORE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true\n\nOnce you have done so and started the service you'll see this message in your browser:\n__ __\n/\\ \\__ /\\ \\__\n__ \\ \\ ,_\\ _____ _ __ ___\\ \\ ,_\\ ___\n/'__'\\ \\ \\ \\/ /\\ '__'\\/\\''__\\/ __'\\ \\ \\/ / __'\\\n/\\ \\L\\.\\_\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\L\\ \\ \\ \\//\\ \\L\\ \\ \\ \\_/\\ \\L\\ \\\n\\ \\__/.\\_\\\\ \\__\\\\ \\ ,__/\\ \\_\\\\ \\____/\\ \\__\\ \\____/\n\\/__/\\/_/ \\/__/ \\ \\ \\/ \\/_/ \\/___/ \\/__/\\/___/\n\\ \\_\\\n\\/_/\n\nThis is an AT Protocol Personal Data Server (aka, an atproto PDS)...\n\nYou should now be able to browse your PDS at it's URL with pdsls. Here's mine. If you haven't set up an account though there won't be any records.\nCreating Accounts\nThe PDS container doesn't include pdsadmin tool, so we'll need another way to make invite codes. You can use pdsadmin-web to do so easily. Before I was aware of that tool, I did an API call via Postman:\n\nHTTP Request\n\nType: POST\nURL: your.pds.tld/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createInviteCode\nBody: raw {&quot;useCount&quot;:1}\nAuth: Basic Auth\n\nUser: admin\nPass: from your pds.env\n\nOnce you have the code, you can go to the Bluesky app, enter your PDS and invite, and create an account as normal. Now, moment of truth, make a test post with some media:\nit is me[image or embed]&mdash; scribe.brad.quest (@scribe.brad.quest) Aug 15, 2025 at 2:09 PM\nYou'll get a 500 error if something goes wrong with uploading an image, meaning S3 isn't working. Double check values in the pds.env and permissions in your OCI account.\nMigrating Accounts\nI used PDS MOOver and it worked perfectly for consolidating 4 accounts on my new PDS. I migrated from Bluesky servers and my own old server. I yolo'ed it and did not follow the precautions, although that seems like a good idea. The process went like this:\nEntry 31 - Migrating from the Bluesky PDS to the #BlackSky PDS with PDS MOOver #SharpieVLOG[image or embed]&mdash; dapurplesharpie 🔜 #ATProto_NYC (@sharpiepls.com) Aug 10, 2025 at 4:39 PM\nYou receive the final PLC code via email. If you are moving from an old self hosted PDS, double check that your SMTP is working properly on that server before attempting this or you won't receive the PLC.\nFuture\n\nDocker pdsadmin?\n\nMore ATProto\n\nBookHive book tracking\nGraze custom feeds\nrecipe.exchange here is a recipe for Cajun dirty rice\nSmoke Signal events &amp; RSVPs\nteal.fm music history ala last.fm",

		"content": "#web #diy #software #webdev #vibecoding\nThis <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"signpost\" href=\"/about/\">site</a> uses the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin to publish to the web. Here are my notes on the changes I've made, which are in my public repo.\nI have a pretty basic knowledge of web development so a lot of this has been an experiment in <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Vibecoding</a>.\nLocal Development\nClone your repo and make sure you npm installed. For VS Code, I added the Nunjucks Template extension for syntax highlighting.\nFrom within the project's folder: npm run build will generate the static site with Eleventy and npx serve dist will start a local server.\nFixing RSS\nOne of the first things I noticed was that the RSS feed is broken. This open issue on Github describes the fix: edit /src/site/feed.njk and add another / escape to the end of each link tag on lines 10, 11, 26.\nHermitage's Forest\nThe author of the plugin has a pretty amazing &quot;forest&quot; visualization on their site. I immediately thought that if I had a similar grid, I could generate a <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"signpost\" href=\"/about/\">dungeon</a> map.\nI first copied their code into my template. You need:\n\nthe functions to generate the forest from userUtils.js\nthe relevant custom css\nthe template that displays the visualization\nthe icon images\n\nOnce I had that working, I began using a coding agent to describe the changes I wanted. The forest has a CSS skew to achieve the isometric view, and the icons are portrait format so that they overlap, giving it depth and a sense of being overgrown.\nI first removed the skew and changed the visualization so it generated a simple table of squares. Then I added square icons from this Zelda-style tileset.\nI did some research on methods to randomly generate dungeon maps and the answer was binary space partitioning, a common algorithm used in rogue-likes. This is the type of thing I would not be able to code on my own, but if you have enough understanding of the problem a coding agent can stitch together the pieces. Modify this function in this file to use this algorithm to return a table... After throwing some vibe code at it and tweaking the styles and metaphors, I arrived at the first version of the dungeon:\n\nSimpleLightbox\nI've used this <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"2\" href=\"/creative/javascript-for-artists/\">library</a> in projects before because as the name suggests, it is very simple.\n\nImport the JS and CSS file into your template\nFor every image you want to have the lightbox function, it needs to have a link to the image source and a lightbox class assigned to it. ex:\n&lt;a href=highres.jpeg class=lightbox&gt;&lt;img src=responsive.jpeg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nYou must initialize the lightbox to look for the images with that class. ex:\n&lt;script&gt;var lightbox = new SimpleLightbox('a.lightbox', {})&lt;/script&gt;\n\nOne problem I found with this is that SimpleLightbox does not support modern &lt;picture&gt; elements which is what the DG plugin uses to serve responsive images. I also wanted it to apply to my whole site without having to do this on every page manually. So I had an agent write a script that adds the class to all images (excluding my dungeon map) and if available, sets the image's source to a more reasonable sized one from the picture element. The script is here.\nVisitor Counter\nI got this idea from Paolo Gabriel, who used the excellent visit-counter project to accomplish this. I put a simple script in my template's footer.\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;center&gt;\n&lt;small&gt;Visits: &lt;span id=&quot;visit-counter&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;\n&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n// Get the current page URL (host + pathname) for consistent counting\nconst currentUrl = window.location.host + window.location.pathname;\nconst encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent(currentUrl);\n\nfetch(`https://visit-counter.vercel.app/counter?page=${encodedUrl}`)\n.then(response =&gt; response.text())\n.then(count =&gt; {\nconsole.log('Visit count:', count);\n// Optional: Display the count on your page\nconst counterElement = document.getElementById('visit-counter');\nif (counterElement) {\ncounterElement.innerHTML = `&lt;code&gt; ${count} &lt;/code&gt;`;\n}\n})\n.catch(error =&gt; {\nconsole.error('Error fetching visit count:', error);\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nWebmentions\n\n[!WARNING] Todo",
