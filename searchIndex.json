		"content": "#books #reading #log #nonfiction #antifascism #read2025\nBlack Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning by Timothy Snyder\nFinished: <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-07-24</a>\nRating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nThoughts: Typically, the motivations of the Nazis &amp; their collaborators are reduced to racism or an inherent evil. This meticulously researched book reveals a more complete picture of the social conditions that led to the Holocaust. The creation of stateless zones, the hollowing or destruction of institutions, &amp; the zero-sum worldview that incentivized ordinary people to reach for the state's levers of murder. All part of an extra-legal machine meant to encourage violent experimentation that could be reified back into the state.\nMany of the stories are very difficult to read: the murder of children, the improvisation of cars as mobile gas chambers, the woman who was buried alive &amp; naked in a pit of corpses. Other details are horrifying in their mundanity: the Nazis originally provided extra rations of alcohol to soldiers who participated in mass murder, but ultimately found it unnecessary.\nThere are also many tales of those who resisted or rescued Jews, often not out of ideology or bravery, but out of the simple humanity the state could not stamp out (&quot;No one ever left my house naked or hungry&quot; one woman explains).\nIt is of course terrifying to recognize that many of these conditions exist today. The extraordinary renditions and the state machinery that enables it, the tech capitalists who wish to be freed from the &quot;inefficiencies&quot; of democracy to innovate in stateless zones, the paranoid, zero-sum worldview of MAGA.... &quot;a warning&quot;\nHighlighted\nMostly listened on audiobooks so only a couple of highlights.\n\nThroughout Europe, this is what rescuers said again and again: that they were behaving normally. ‚ÄúWe regarded it as the most normal thing to help those who needed help‚Äù‚Äîthus the verdict of a Polish family who sheltered two Jews for much of the war. They were not describing the normality that they saw around them, of course. They were not acting as others acted, or following the explicit or implicit prescriptions of those in power. Their sense of normality must have come from within, or from something learned and internalized before the war, since there were few or no external sources of the norms they exemplified\n\nWanda J.‚Äôs judgment about the decisive importance of a sense of humanity seems like a hopeful conclusion, but it is not. Good and evil can be rendered visible, as in memoirs such as hers, but they are not easy to summon or dismiss. Most of us would like to think that we possess the qualities she named: ‚Äúmoral instinct‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman goodness.‚Äù Perhaps we imagine that we would be rescuers in some future catastrophe. Yet if states were destroyed, local institutions corrupted, and economic incentives directed towards murder, few of us would behave well.",

Made it 30% in and I simply don't want to read pages of exposition on video game mechanics, lootboxes, or popup achievements - all drenched in the worst kind of juvenile &quot;edgy&quot; humor. One dimensional character who exists only as set dressing for an uninspired re-hash of The Hunger Games. I'm baffled by how widely recommended this series is or that this is supposedly the best of so-called &quot;LitRPG&quot;. I enjoy a pulpy fantasy book every once in a while, but this is simply bad.",

He aims for 10% reduction\n\nHighlighted\n\nI believe large numbers of people have at least some talent as writers and storytellers, and that those talents can be strengthened and sharpened.\n\n&quot;When you write a story, you‚Äôre telling yourself the story,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.&quot;\n\nWhat you need to remember is that there‚Äôs a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not.\n\nThe situation comes first. The characters‚Äîalways flat and unfeatured, to begin with‚Äîcome next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate.\n\nA strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me.\n\nDescription begins in the writer‚Äôs imagination, but should finish in the reader‚Äôs.\n\nWhen it comes to scene-setting and all sorts of description, a meal is as good as a feast\n\nIn a very real sense, every life is in medias res.\n\nThe most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn‚Äôt very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don‚Äôt get carried away with the rest.",
