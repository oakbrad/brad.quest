### [*On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft*](https://library.brads.house/index.php?page=13&id=841#cover) by Stephen King
**Finished:** [[Journal/2025/2025-07-23\|2025-07-23]]
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ 
**Thoughts:** Good writing advice sprinkled among anecdotes, some more interesting than others.

* Kill all adverbs
* First draft "with the door closed" for yourself
* Second draft for the hypothetical *Ideal Reader*
* Second draft should be shorter than the first. He aims for 10% reduction
##### Highlighted 
> I believe large numbers of people have at least some talent as writers and storytellers, and that those talents can be strengthened and sharpened.

> "When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story."

> What you need to remember is that there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not.

> The situation comes first. The characters—always flat and unfeatured, to begin with—come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate.

> A strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me.

> Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.

> When it comes to scene-setting and all sorts of description, a meal is as good as a feast

> In a very real sense, every life is in medias res.

> The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest.
