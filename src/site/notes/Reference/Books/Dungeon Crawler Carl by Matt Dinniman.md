### [*Dungeon Crawler Carl*](https://library.brads.house/index.php?page=13&id=834#cover) by Matt Dinniman
**Finished:** DNF
**Rating:** ‚≠ê
**Thoughts:** Quite possibly the worst thing I have ever attempted to read. Made it 30% in and I simply don't want to read pages of exposition on video game mechanics, lootboxes, or popup achievements - all drenched in the worst kind of juvenile "edgy" humor. One dimensional character who exists only as set dressing for an uninspired re-hash of *The Hunger Games*. I'm baffled by how widely recommended this series is or that this is supposedly the best of so-called "LitRPG". I enjoy a pulpy fantasy book every once in a while, but this is simply bad.
