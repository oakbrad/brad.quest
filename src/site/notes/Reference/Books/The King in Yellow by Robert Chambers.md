### *[The King in Yellow](https://library.brads.house/index.php?page=13&id=832#cover)* by Robert W Chambers
**Finished:** [[Journal/2025/2025-07-26\|2025-07-26]]
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐
**Thoughts:** Stylistically (and chronologically) halfway between Poe and Lovecraft, a collection of short stories about a forbidden play whose second act drives people mad. The first story, *"The Repairer of Reputations"*, was the strongest and then they get less supernatural (and less interesting) as the book progresses.
