[Permethrin](https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/repellent-treated-clothing) is a highly effective insecticide that can be applied to clothing and [[Reference/Outdoors/Gear/Gear\|Gear]] to kill ticks and other disease bearing pests you find in the woods.
* Most formulations for livestock contain petroleum products, which stink like gasoline and aren't suitable for human use
* Sunlight & oxygen degrade the effectiveness - store treated gear in black plastic bags 
# Method
Permethrin is relatively safe, but wear PPE and don't handle the wet solution directly. Spray items outdoors in a well ventilated area. Beware that it is [toxic to cats](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/11/627843581/if-you-spray-your-clothes-with-permethrin-be-careful-around-the-cat).
### Soak
> *Lasts a season, or at least a dozen washes.*

For soaking small items, an efficient way to do it is in large ziploc bags.
For a large amount of clothing or gear like tents, use a 5 gallon bucket.
### Spray
> *Lasts about 6-8 weeks and 4-6 washes*

For spraying gear, you want to attempt to soak it heavily.
For outerwear, spray both the inside and outside.
# Dilution
> **TLDR:** *For a **26oz** spray bottle, add **1.3oz** of 10% permethrin*

Permethrin can be bought in 10% concentrate. 
For safe application to clothing, it needs to be diluted to 0.5%
### Math
$$

C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2

$$

**Where:**
- $C_1$ = initial concentration (**10%**)
- $V_1$ = volume of initial solution to use (unknown)
- $C_2$ = final concentration (**0.5%**)
- $V_2$ = final total volume (**26 oz**)

**Plug in the values:**
$$

10\% \times V_1 = 0.5\% \times 26\,\text{oz}

$$

$$
V_1 = \frac{0.5 \times 26}{10}
$$

$$

V_1 = \frac{13}{10} = 1.3\,\text{oz}

$$
