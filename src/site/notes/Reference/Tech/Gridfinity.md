[Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) is a [popular](https://www.printables.com/search/models?ctx=models&q=gridfinity), [[Projects/3D Printing/3D Printing\|printable]] organizer system based on an open source [spec](https://gridfinity.xyz/specification/) of `42x42x7mm` boxes by [Zach Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZackFreedman).
# Gridfinity Basics
## Baseplates
I use two different baseplates:
* [Magnet-Light Baseplates](https://www.printables.com/model/250550-gridfinity-magnet-light-baseplate) sturdy & reasonable print time that retains the magnet/screw holes
* Ultralight Baseplates are very fast to print & best where vertical space is limited (ie. drawers)

When butting baseplates together into a larger grid, I find it helpful to run [a deburring tool](https://amzn.to/46t4ecl) around the outer edges.
## Bins
A few notable improvements on Zach's original collection of bins.
* [Corrugated Light Bins](https://thangs.com/designer/ImprovedByDesign/3d-model/Corrugated%2520Gridfinity%2520Light%2520Bins%2520%2528No%2520vase%2520mode%2529-1091242)

## Transport Trays
An essential piece of organization for grouping bins by project so they can be moved from storage to workbench.

Tools for generating bins, bases, and accessories.
* [Gridfinity Extended](https://docs.ostat.com/docs/openscad/gridfinity-extended) and [Gridfinity Rebuilt](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad) are both [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) implementations
