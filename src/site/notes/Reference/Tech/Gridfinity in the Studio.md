[Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) is a [popular](https://www.printables.com/search/models?ctx=models&q=gridfinity), [[Projects/3D Printing/3D Printing\|printable]] organizer system based on an open source [spec](https://gridfinity.xyz/specification/) of `42x42x7mm` boxes by [Zach Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZackFreedman). I use this system extensively in my studio.
# Gridfinity Basics
## Baseplates
I use these baseplates:
* [Magnet-Light Baseplates](https://www.printables.com/model/250550-gridfinity-magnet-light-baseplate) sturdy & reasonable print time that retains the magnet/screw holes
* [Ultralight Skeleton](https://www.printables.com/model/1117131-gridfinity-ultralight-base) minimum amount of material 

When butting baseplates together into a larger grid, I find it helpful to run [a deburring tool](https://amzn.to/46t4ecl) around the outer edges.
## Bins
A few notable improvements on Zach's original collection of bins:
* [Vase Mode Bins](https://www.printables.com/model/353012-gridfinity-enhanced-vase-bins-wth-labels-90-models/comments) Fastest possible bin
* [Corrugated Light Bins](https://thangs.com/designer/ImprovedByDesign/3d-model/Corrugated%2520Gridfinity%2520Light%2520Bins%2520%2528No%2520vase%2520mode%2529-1091242) Fast & strong bins
* [Glass Window Bins](https://thangs.com/designer/Landrum%20Engineering/3d-model/Gridfinity%20Octa%20Windowed%20Bins%202x2x12-886840) an improved [microscope slide](https://amzn.to/3J2EYQs) design
* [Parametric Bottles](https://www.printables.com/model/278947-gridfinity-parametric-bottle-with-knurledfluted-ca) with caps
## Other Essentials
Not bins or baseplates, but things I make extensive use of:
* [Transport Trays](https://thangs.com/designer/atucom/3d-model/Gridfinity%2520Transport%2520Tray-65965) I group projects by tray and then can move them easily between shelf and workspace.
* [Gridfinity Under Counter Drawers](https://www.printables.com/model/284027-gen2-gridfinity-drawers-standard-legacy) over designed with tight tolerances, but they work really well.
* [Gridfinity Stackable Drawers](https://www.printables.com/model/503548-gridfinity-drawer) good for desks or vertical storage. I made a [glass slide version](https://www.printables.com/model/624484-gridfinity-2x2-drawer-with-microscope-slide-window/comments) of the drawer bin.
# Parametric Gridfinity
Tools for generating bins, bases, and accessories.
* [Gridfinity Extended](https://docs.ostat.com/docs/openscad/gridfinity-extended) and [Gridfinity Rebuilt](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad) are both [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) implementations
* [Gridfinity toolbox from photo](https://outline.georgs.lv/)
* [Gridfinity Generator](https://gridfinity.perplexinglabs.com/) by Perplexing Labs
* [Gridfinity Box, Baseplate, and Cutout Generator](https://gridfinitygenerator.com)
* [Gridfinity Creator](https://gridfinity.bouwens.co/)
* [Parametric Bottles](https://www.printables.com/model/278947-gridfinity-parametric-bottle-with-knurledfluted-ca)

There is also a Gridfinity [Fusion360 App](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=7197558650811789) and the python library [cq-gridfinity](https://github.com/michaelgale/cq-gridfinity)
