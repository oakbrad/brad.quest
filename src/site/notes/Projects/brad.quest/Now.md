# What am I up to currently?
Professionally, since the pandemic I've been mostly focused on providing [digital capture services](https://bradwenner.digital/) to photo productions. I like being on set and solving problems with other creative people.

My current personal projects involve [[Projects/Programming Projects\|learning Python]] and hacking away on an [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/)-based [[Projects/Pyora MUD/Playing MUDs in 2025\|MUD]] game. I've also been exploring AI [[Reference/Tech/Vibecoding\|vibecoding]] tools and have had some success turning [data into visualizations](https://github.com/oakbrad/dungeonchurch-oracle), which is something I want to [[Reference/Tech/Javascript for Artists\|explore]] more of.

My tabletop [gaming group](https://www.dungeon.church/) recently finished up a nearly 3 year, 50+ session D&D campaign. A long term project of mine has been turning [the things we make](https://github.com/oakbrad/dungeonchurch-pyora) into [open source materials](https://github.com/oakbrad/dungeonchurch) others can use in their adventures.

And as often as possible, you'll find me riding my [[Reference/Outdoors/Bicycles\|bikes]] around Oakland [[Journal/Taco Log\|eating tacos]].
